Data Analysis Project

Project 1: Airline Customer Satisfaction (Dano Airlines)
 Analysis of over 120,000 passenger records revealed that Dano Airlines’ overall satisfaction rate dropped to 43.4%, driven primarily by Economy-class passengers, who recorded the lowest satisfaction (18.8%). Business-class travelers showed strong satisfaction (69.4%), highlighting a clear service gap across travel classes. Long arrival delays and poor in-flight Wi-Fi emerged as the biggest drivers of dissatisfaction, particularly among leisure and first-time travelers. These insights indicate that targeted improvements in Economy-class service quality, delay management, and onboard connectivity would yield the greatest impact in restoring customer satisfaction above 50%.
Project 2: Restaurant Ratings in Mexico
 The restaurant ratings analysis showed that consumer preferences strongly influence restaurant performance, with Mexican cuisine dominating demand and achieving higher ratings. The dataset revealed a market skew toward young, student, medium-budget consumers, indicating sampling bias but also highlighting a profitable core customer segment. A clear demand–supply gap exists for medium-priced restaurants offering popular cuisines, alcohol service, and parking availability. These insights suggest strong investment opportunities in mid-range, youth-oriented restaurants that align service offerings with consumer preferences.
Project 3: Employee Survey Analysis (Pierce County, WA)
 Employee survey data (14,725 responses) indicated moderate overall job satisfaction (2.96/5), with strong agreement around role clarity, leadership support, and organizational mission. However, dissatisfaction clustered around recognition, belonging, and work relationships, particularly among frontline staff and in larger departments. The analysis highlights a perception gap between leadership and staff and points to cultural rather than structural issues. Data-driven recommendations focused on strengthening recognition practices, improving manager effectiveness, and implementing department-level engagement action plans to sustainably improve employee satisfaction.
